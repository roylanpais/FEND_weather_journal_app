# FEND_weather_journal_app

The Udacity FEND Project-3: Weather-Journal App

This project requires you to create an asynchronous web app that uses Web API and user data to dynamically update the UI in a Weather Journal application.

This is a simple web application that allows users to enter their zip code and feelings, and it displays the weather information along with the user's input.

The JavaScript code handles the functionality of the Weather Journal app. It makes API requests to retrieve weather data, handles user input and interaction, and updates the UI with the fetched data.


The project can be run by running the command "node server.js" in the root directory and then opening http://localhost:8000/ in browser.
Run the command 'npm install' to install required dependencies
Dependencies: express cors body-parser
